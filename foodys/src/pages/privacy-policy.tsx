                      content. However, when you share personal information in
                      public areas of a FOODYS.ONE Website, it may be visible

                      Failure to provide personal information online will not
                      result in material consequences. However, it may limit
                      your ability to engage in specific promotions, receive
                      product information, or utilize portions of a FOODYS.ONE

                      FOODYS.ONE retains personal data only as long as
                      reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was
                      collected. The duration varies based on the type of
                      personal information and the reasons for its collection.
                      Factors considered in determining the retention period
                      include legal obligations under applicable laws, statutory
                      limitations, potential disputes, and guidelines issued by
